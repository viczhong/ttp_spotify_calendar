## FrontEnd

Made with Swift 4 with no imported libraries for max compatibility, using a combination of MVC and MVVM (for reusability and easier testing). 

## BackEnd

Made with Heroku with Angular CLI and MongoDB. Deployed at [https://desolate-cliffs-10757.herokuapp.com/events/](https://desolate-cliffs-10757.herokuapp.com/events/)

P.S. Left out 300 mb of Node, e2e, and misc files to save space so cloning this project isn't a nightmare.
